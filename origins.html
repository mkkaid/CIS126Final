      <h2>Origins of Esports</h2>
      <p>Esports, short for electronic sports, refers to competitive video gaming. Its origins can be traced back to the late 20th century when video game enthusiasts started competing against each other in organized events.</p>
      
      <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
      <p>One of the earliest known esports competitions took place in 1972 at Stanford University, where students competed in a game of Spacewar, a space combat video game developed in the early 1960s.</p>
      
      <h3>The Rise of Arcades</h3>
      <p>Esports gained popularity in the 1980s with the rise of video game arcades. Games like Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and Street Fighter became iconic titles in arcade gaming, and players began competing for high scores and bragging rights.</p>
      
      <h3>The Birth of LAN Parties</h3>
      <p>In the 1990s, with the widespread availability of personal computers and local area networks (LANs), gamers started organizing LAN parties, where they would connect their computers to play multiplayer games together. LAN parties laid the groundwork for modern esports tournaments.</p>
      
      <h3>Online Gaming and Professionalization</h3>
      <p>The advent of online gaming in the late 1990s and early 2000s further fueled the growth of esports. Games like Quake, StarCraft, and Counter-Strike became popular choices for competitive play, and professional esports teams and leagues began to emerge.</p>
      
      <h3>Evolution into a Global Phenomenon</h3>
      <p>Today, esports has evolved into a global phenomenon, with professional players, teams, and tournaments drawing millions of viewers worldwide. Major esports events fill stadiums, and top players compete for millions of dollars in prize money.</p>
